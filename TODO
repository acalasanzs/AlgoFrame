✓1. Set base class for Keyframes: Timeline

✓1.5. Set nesting to Timeline base class: return Timeline.test: Timeline => Timeline.test: number
//1.75 ...And duration limits within sequence timeline
Timeline -> Sequence

2. Set multiple channels on AlgoFrame.timeline with each being a Sequence.
2.5. SET EVENTS TO AlgoFrame.Animate.timeline() 
    Important to set UID's before importing to the framework Algoframe.timeline

3. Flexible timeline framework = including:
    .add(event: Timeline.event): add an event to the global timeline (.enlarge if necessary without expanding or shrinking the whole timeline, adjusting all events).
    .del(UID: number): remove an event but adjusting nothing.
    .enlarge(number): adds time to the global timeline,        shrinking the curreent timeline respectively.
    shift(miliseconds: number): cut/shift end of the timeline in miliseconds, adjusting all the keyframes so them remain equivalent in time. 
    .shrink(number),
    shiftByEvent(position: "before" | "after", UID: number): cut before/after the begin/end of an event in a timeline, adjusting all the keyframes so them remain equivalent in time. 
    .expand(miliseconds: number): add 'miliseconds' to the global timeline (.enlarge if necessary without expanding or shrinking the whole timeline, adjusting all events).
4. Sequencing: Nested Algoframe.timeline(s)
